# Simple Java Projects

This repository contains simple, beginner-friendly Java tutorials and practice projects.

I'm using these exercises to build a solid foundation in Java before diving into the Spring Boot framework. The aim here is to get comfortable with core Java concepts and syntax through hands-on examples.

Each project has a README explaining what concepts where used etc...
